# E4GL3-TARKOV-ESCAPRE

# This "transparent" custom launcher blocks the game's ability to override any custom graphical configuration made by the user.

# USAGE:
- First time you open the launcher it will ask you to locate your "Battlestate Games" folder
- When you want to play just launch this program instead of the original launcher (wich will be automatically chainloaded) 
- The program must remain active when the game is on and will auto close whenever you quit the game
